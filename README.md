## Project Tasty Drink Bar & Shop

Tasty Drink Bar & Shop is a personal project for an ecommerce bar & store realized with Symfony 7.

I created this project from scratch.
I started by wireframing all the pages on sheets of paper. Then I made the mock-ups in Figma.
When I finished the mock-ups, I used Trello to keep track of the project step by step.

The next step was to make the front-end. I started by doing all the front-end with hard code. Then it was time for the back-end. I created all the tables and connections. Once the back-end was finished, I moved on to the dynamic site.

## Project's goal

Create an ecommerce site for Tasty Drink Bar & Shop, showing the quality of the service offered in the bar and store.

## The owners of the site

Amanda and Lucas Atkinson are the owners of Tasty Drink Bar & Shop. They set up the company in 2021. Tasty Drink Bar & Shop is a store in the morning and a bar in the evening. They want to promote their company throughout Canada, but also worldwide. They want to turn the company into a national and international tourist attraction.

## How the tasty drink company came about

On the Our Story page, we see how Amanda and Lucas developed the company. We also have a short summary of the store, the bar and a gallery of the products on offer.

1- Shop
In the Tasty Drink B&S store, you'll find drinks from many different countries. The products include champagne, wine, beer, tequila and more.

2 - Bar
The bar service offers drinks and a menu to enjoy with friends, colleagues and family. Inside the bar, the architecture is made of black metal and wood. On the terrace, an open space is available to enjoy the view of the Vancouver mountains.

## The team

On our team page, we have pictures of the professionals who work in the company: the bar and store managers, the waiters and waitresses in the bar and the team working in the kitchen.

All employees and positions are created by the site administrator using easyadmin.

## Bar and Menus

In the navigation bar, you'll find Bar-Menu. The bar has information about the architecture, the inside and terrace of the bar.

The menu section contains the drinks and food menus. Here you can download the drink and food menus offered at the bar and consult them whenever you want.

## The connection

Users create their account on the Sign up page of Tasty Drink B&S. As soon as they have created their account, they have access to their control panel where they can check their purchases; create or modify the addresses registered on the site; have a list of their most desired products; they can also change their password and make a reservation at the Tasty Drink B&S bar.

In addition to the connection part, users can give their opinions on products. Each review will be generated by the site administrator in order to provide only reviews that are consistent with the service offered by the company.

## The product

Each product has information about its category, country, color, description and price.

The user can only give a review once for each product. When a user gives a review, the site administrator can accept it or not. The maximum number of reviews that will be shown for each product is 3.

## Shop

This is where customers buy their products. They have access to all the products on offer in the store. Customers can search for their products in the dynamic menu or on the shop page.

On the Our products page, you'll find a filter where you can browse products by name, type, country, color or price.

The customer can add products to the product basket. In the basket of products section, the customer can add or reduce the quantity of a product; they can delete it from the basket; or they can clear the basket of products altogether.

When the user validates the purchase, if they don't have an address, they will be sent to the my account page to create their address. Once the address has been created, the user is sent to the Order page to confirm the address and shipping company.

A full summary of the purchase appears on the Summary page. Here the user validates the purchase, and the user enters the credit card number to finalize the purchase.

If the card is approved, the customer is sent to the my order page, where he can consult all the purchase information. If he wishs, he can also print or download the invoice.

The customer and the owner receive an email each one with the main details of the purchase.

On the administrative side, the site administrator can change the purchase status in three parts:

- Purchase in progress
- Purchase sent
- Purchase canceled

The administrator can consult and also print or download the invoice.

## Security

Security is very important on a website, especially for ecommerce. In the security.yaml file, users are only given permissions to visit user pages. If a customer tries to access an administration page, a 404 page will be displayed to say that the page doesn't exist.

Another security system is the CSRF token. This is a random token used in all forms for each user session. This token is entered with a hidden parameter.

## Payment

I have used Stripe to create the payment system. The user pays with their credit card. The email of Stripe contains the user's login email. If the payment is approved, the user goes to their account page to check their purchase.

**AS THIS PROJECT IS FICTITIOUS, PAYMENT ON STRIPE USES CREDIT CARD CODE 4242 4242 4242 4242 FOR TESTS.
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES USE YOUR CREDIT CARD ON THE SITE TO PAY.**

<hr>

## Contact

The contact page is a form where customers can request information about services, special dates or even ask about products on the menu.
The administrator receives an email and so does the customer with the contact information.

## Reservation

Here users can make reservations for special events or even a simple dinner for two. The company receives the information via email and an email is sent to the client to have a copy of the booking information.

## Newsletter

In the footer of each page, we have the newsletter, where users can submit their e-mail address and receive information about new products and discounts offered by Tasty Drink B&S.

## Terms & conditions - privacy policy

In the footer, users can consult the company's terms and conditions as well as the privacy policy.
